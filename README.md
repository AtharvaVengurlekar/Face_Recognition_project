# üéØ Face Recognition Using ArcFace (InsightFace)

This project performs **face recognition on local videos** using the powerful **ArcFace model** from InsightFace. It processes input videos, detects and embeds faces, and identifies them across frames.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Converts videos into frames.
- Detects and embeds faces using InsightFace (ArcFace).
- Enhances frames (CLAHE, brightness, contrast).
- Optional angle filtering for high-accuracy embeddings.
- Identifies known faces from new videos using precomputed embeddings.
- Works on CPU or GPU (CUDA-enabled).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Face_Recognition_project.git
cd Face_Recognition_project
````

### 2. Create & Activate Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n face_recognition_env python=3.10
conda activate face_recognition_env
```

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üìú Main Scripts & Usage

### 1. `video2frames.py` ‚Äì Convert Video to Frames

Converts videos from the `inputs/` folder into frames for processing.

```bash
python video2frames.py
```

---

### 2. `create_face_embeddings_arcface.py` ‚Äì Generate Face Embeddings

Generates facial embeddings (with or without angle filtering) from the extracted frames. Make sure to set `input_dir` and `output_dir` inside the script.

```bash
python create_face_embeddings_arcface.py
```

---

### 3. `face_identification_local_video_arc_face.py` ‚Äì Face Identification in New Video

Matches detected faces from a test video against the stored embeddings. Customize input and output paths in the script.

```bash
python face_identification_local_video_arc_face.py
```
