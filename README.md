# 🎯 Face Recognition with ArcFace (InsightFace)

This project performs **face recognition on local videos** using the high-accuracy **ArcFace model** from InsightFace. It detects, embeds, and identifies faces from video frames using precomputed facial embeddings. Ideal for both research and real-world applications.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎥 **Video to Frames**: Automatically extracts frames from input videos.
- 🧠 **Face Embeddings**: Uses ArcFace via InsightFace to create robust facial embeddings.
- 🎛️ **Image Enhancement**: Improves frame quality using CLAHE, brightness, and contrast adjustments.
- 🎯 **Angle Filtering (Optional)**: Filters embeddings based on face orientation for improved accuracy.
- 🧍‍♂️ **Face Identification**: Compares faces in test videos with known faces using vector similarity.
- ⚡ **CPU & GPU Support**: Runs efficiently on both CPU and CUDA-enabled GPUs.

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Face_Recognition_Project.git
cd Face_Recognition_Project
```

### 2️⃣ Create and Activate a Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n face_recognition_env python=3.10
conda activate face_recognition_env
```

### 3️⃣ Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##🔁 1. Convert Video to Frames

### Extracts image frames from videos placed in the inputs/ folder.
```bash
python video2frames.py
```

##🧬 2. Generate Face Embeddings

###Creates ArcFace embeddings for faces detected in the frames.
#Embeddings will be stored in either:

-vector_embeddings_with_angle/ (angle-based Threshold)
-vector_embeddings_no_angle/ (no Threshold)

##🕵️ 3. Identify Faces in a New Video

###Compares new video frames against the known embeddings.
```bash
python face_identification_local_video_arc_face.py
```
